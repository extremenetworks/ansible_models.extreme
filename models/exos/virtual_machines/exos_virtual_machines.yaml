  module: exos_guest_virtual_machines
  version_added: "2.10"
  short_description:  Manage virtual machines on EXOS devices.
  description: This module can be used to create new Virtual machines on EXOS network devices, 
               manage operational state such as start, stop, restart,
               update its components such as CPUs, memory, virtual ports, disks etc. and
               delete a virtual service with all its associated components.
