  module: exos_guest_virtual_machines
  version_added: "2.10"
  short_description:  Manage guest virtual machines on EXOS devices.
  description: 
    - This module can be used to create guest Virtual machines on EXOS network devices
    - Manages operational state such as start, stop and restart
    - Updates its components such as CPUs, memory, virtual ports, disks etc.
    - delete a virtual machine with all its associated components.

            - An Insight port assigned as a dedicated port to a VM cannot be used to define a virtual interface for any VM or vice versa.
            - An Insight port can have maximum of 16 active virtual interfaces associated with it at a time.
